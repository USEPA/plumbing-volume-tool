# Plumbing Volume Estimator Tool

This Excel file was created for the purpose of generating a plumbing map for a building. A plumbing map is comprised of all the various plumbing materials in a building along a specific water flow route. It includes the plumbing material types and lengths and calculates the volume of water contained within each section. This information can provide the user with a more realistic understanding of the volume of water along a length of plumbing (ex. from faucet tap to main) and allows the user to pinpoint lead source locations or potential lead source locations (ex. copper pipe with lead/tin solder, lead service line, galvanized iron pipe) by water volume.

This information can then be used to tailor meaningful water sampling for lead (or other contaminants), rather than relying on a static volume (such as first liter) (Triantafyllidou et al., 2021). For example, with this tool users will be able to calculate the volume of water at an individual residence between the residentâ€™s faucet tap and the water main. This reduces uncertainty in sequential (profile) sampling for lead sources as the user will be able to more accurately estimate the volume of, and number of bottles needed to capture all potential sources, improving laboratory estimates, and reducing costs by not overestimating supplies and analyses. Users will also be able to pinpoint lead sources and can therefore sample water that has sat stagnant with those identified sources of interest. An improvement over relying on static volumes that may not represent lead sources in an individual building being evaluated, as plumbing configurations vary (Triantafyllidou et al., 2021).


## Configuration

The plumbing volume estimator tool is a Microsoft Excel file. Within the zip file there are two versions of the tool, one with macros to assist the user in data entry PlumbingVolumeEstimatorTool_Macro-Enabled.xlsm) and one non-macro version (PlumbingVolumeEstimatorTool_Non-MacroVersion.xlsx). The non-macro version is for use on platforms that do not support/allow use of macros. This tool was designed using Microsoft Excel for Microsoft 365 MSO 64-bit, on a Windows 11 Enterprise Operating System.
